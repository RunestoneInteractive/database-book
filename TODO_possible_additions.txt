This not-quite correct example was in 12.1 as a possible exercise. I think right now I might not want an exercise there at all- just illustrate an interesting advanced times example as prelude to later.

Queries to try
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try creating the precedence chart for the following query. 

**English Query:**

  How does each creatureâ€™s achieved skill proficiency compare to other creatures who have achieved the lowest proficiency at that skill?

After getting server set up, switch to this type of thing:

.. tabbed:: Asp_Creature_MJ_1

    .. tab:: SQL Times-Filter-Reduce MJ query

      .. activecode:: asp_cr_MJ_S_E
        :language: sql
        :include: all_creature_create

        -- Aspiration with its Creature data
                    -- reduce by removing B.creatureId
        SELECT A.*, B.creatureName, B.creatureType, 
                    B.reside_townId, B.idol_creatureId
        FROM Aspiration A, Creature B       -- times
        WHERE A.creatureId = B.creatureId   -- equality match filter
        ;


    .. tab:: SQL Inner Join MJ query

      .. activecode:: asp_cr_MJ_S_E_inner
        :language: sql
        :include: all_creature_create

        -- Aspiration with its Creature data
                    -- reduce by removing B.creatureId, B.origin_townId
        SELECT A.*, B.creatureName, B.creatureType, 
                    B.reside_townId, B.idol_creatureId
        FROM Aspiration A
        INNER JOIN Creature B            -- like MJ operator symbol
        ON A.creatureId = B.creatureId   -- match filter over cols
        ;
